Description:
An Auto-Aiming Robot System using Python utilizes computer vision libraries like OpenCV and machine learning algorithms to detect and track targets automatically. The system processes real-time video feed to identify objects, calculates their position, and adjusts the robot's aim accordingly. Python's flexibility and powerful libraries make it ideal for developing such systems, enabling precise control and efficient target tracking for applications like security or automated defense systems.

Arjuna:

Arjuna is the python script that uses a camera to track your hand and arduino based laser turret (aka Timby) will follow your hand with high accuracy.
Rahul has implemented smaller variants of features in Arjuna across frameworks and organizations
